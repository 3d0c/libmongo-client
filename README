This is an alternative C driver for MongoDB, with slightly different
goals than the official one.

We're not so strict on dependencies (we're using glib), and the API is
very different too.

Apart from glib, there are no other hard dependencies. Though, one
will need OpenSSL for authentication support, and Perl to run the test
suite.

The main purpose of this library is to provide a well maintained
implementation, that suits a wider range of needs than the original:

* Ability to easily construct mongodb commands, to be sent at a later
  time (comes in handy when one is trying to write from a separate
  thread).
* C-like error handling. No toying around with exceptions.
* Comprehensive test suite.
* Strict error handling.
* ReplicaSet support, and automatic reconnecting and discovery.
* Connection pooling.
* Well documented API.

Although the code is not based on any other driver, it is released
under the same Apache License, version 2.0 (included as the file
LICENSE).
