* 0.0.2 - UNRELEASED

** Replica set seeding support
It is now possible to add seeds to a connection, so that the library
can try connecting to those in case automatic discovery fails (or if
the seeds are hidden).

** Failover redesign
Instead of preemptively pinging & checking for a master before each
and every command, the library does so only upon errors. This way,
when everything's working as expected, there is no extra
overhead. Yet, if things go wrong, failover will still work.

By design, automatic failover only occurs when an error is detected
during a write operation. When an error occurs during read, it will be
propagated back to the application.

Automatic failover is disabled by default, and can be turned on via
the mongo_sync_conn_set_auto_reconnect() function.

** safe-mode support
With safe mode enabled, extra care will be taken to ensure that data
gets to the server, and that the library does everything within its
power to maintain a connection.

This means that after insert and update operations, the library will
issue a getLastError command, and only return successfully if that
command did not signal an error.

Safe-mode also enables the previously default preemptive connection
checks (along with the post-mortem failover).

Safe-mode is off by default.
